Reasoning: Goal Trees and Rule-Based Expert Systems

1. Tree general
- Computer programs answer "Why did you do it?" by answering the question which is above
- "How did you do it?" By answering the method which is below

2. Trees:
- Goal tree (AND-OR) tree
- n-tree
- Complexity(Behavior) = MAX [ complexity(Program) && complexity(Environment)]

3. Expert system:
- Making from small group of statements => rules
- (it is cat, it runs fast, it lives in africa) => cheetah

4. Forward-chaining rule-based "expert" system. (DEDUCATION)
- This is in fact a goal-tree
- They are actually "novice" systems
- You determine by being provided characteristics of a cat, if it's a cheetah
- From Facts => Conclusion

5. Backward-chaining rule-based "expert" system
- You are being asked if a cat is a cheetah, and you do the reverse of forward-chaining, by trying
to make sure if the rules are correct 
- This is a cheeta, how do I prove this hypothesis?
- Algorithm: From Hypothesis => Facts

6. Knowledge-engineering rules:
6.1. Specific cases: Test different cases, because people don't tell you everything.
6.2. Ask questions about things appear to be the same, but handled differently. You need to make  anew rule for them.
6.3. You build a system and you see when it cracks. And it cracks when there is a missing rule, which is not handled.
You make an experiment on yourself and discover that some program is missing.
