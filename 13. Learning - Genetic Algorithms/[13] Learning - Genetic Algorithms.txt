13. Learning: Genetic Algorithms
12.09.2017

Description:
This lecture explores genetic algorithms at a conceptual level. 
We consider three approaches to how a population evolves towards desirable traits, ending with ranks of both fitness and diversity. 
We briefly discuss how this space is rich with solutions.

0. General:
- [PRINCIPLE]: DIVERSITY IS GOOD
  In order to survive, an organism needs to be able to FIT, and also to be [DIVERSE]
- [PRINCIPLE]: ASK WHERE THE CREDIT LIES
  Usually, people are claiming the credit, are lying where it has originated.
  Is it the algorithm that simply works, or is it the developer who hand-tuned it on purpose to work well?
- [Science]: The collection and documentatio of observable facts and an ongoing discussion about how those facts can be best linked
  together in order to form expalantions.
- [Chromosomes]: How is information encoded in genes? 
  Some of the genes provide information on how many [objects there are].
  Others provide information on the size of the object. 
  Others provide information how two objects are pieced together (0, 90, 180 degrees of bounding and etc.)
  And others provide information on the control and movement functions of the object. 
- [Alleles]: Different value variants of the same gene.
  Example: Gene of eyes -> Alleles: Brown, Green, Blue.
- [Dominant and recessive alleles]: In all organisms, there are [dominant] and [recessive] values for each allel. The dominant one overshadows
  the recessive allel.
  BROWN-blue - two dominand alleles (dominant allel overshadows the recessive)
  BROWN-BROWN - two dominadn alleles 
  blue-blue   - two recessive alleles
- [Generations]: It all starts from nature (again): As volcanos erupt and form layers of dust and flora and fauna get burried in the soil,
  different layers of soil form, each one representing a different epoch of time with its own distinct characteristics.
- [cornucopia]: a large amount of supply of something
- [chocolate]: generates a mild high
- God throw all the dices before we were born
- Humans are made of chemicals
- The RNA constantly changes with mutations and only successful mutations get transferred in the generations
- Small genes are used by ribosomes to build small proteins and vice versa
- Humans and monkeys have 96% the same DNA
- Scientists have created microorganisms which can create insulin
- A gene contains instructions how to create a protein
- When mitosis (cell splitting) occurs, the nucleus is copied twice, then the cell is split from the center.
  If anything goes wrong between some of the nucleotides, DNA mutation occurs. Radiation causes a lot of DNA mutations in cells
- Mating: Half of the male and half of the female DNA are combined together in a new individual, who has traits from both of them
- Humans breeded all types of dogs from few base wolf species
- Natural selection: Nature forcing selectively only certain genes and features to be tranferred in generations
  Basically all traits, which differ people, are features which have been modified over time. 
  For instance, snakes' poison is actually a modified saliva
- Theory of life by Alexander Oranin: Basic chemical structures formed basic organisms after reactions, which later formed more complex 
  living organisms
- Miller-Urey experiment: Try to simulate the basic conditions in old Earth, by applying natural energy modifiers to them. It has been 
  observed, that the water used in the experiment (which went through consant 'natural' chemical reactions) became black, containing a lot
  amin acids and proteins, which are required to create life.
- RNA chemistry theory on how life formed: particles of RNA have formed together to produce proteins
- Life: Repeating patterns of chemical reactions via molecules
- Friedrich Wohler: Created urine via chemistry in 1828. Until then it was thought that only living organisms can create organic substances
- Are we really alive then? Or is it just a chemical reaction with perks, which can be either slowed down or fastened by our actions?
- Chemical evolution: Simple molecules react with other molecules, as the environment changes (temperature, rain, etc.)
- Evolution: The size of fishes globally is shrinking, because fishers keep tossing back small fish back to the sea, so only small fish
  traits are passed on
- Desert theory: As humans expand and kill animals, there are no animals left to graze the grass. Andre Voisin has discovered that
  some grass types have built dependency on being grazing by animals, in order to re-grow. It's not actually even a theory, since he moved
  some animals to a desert with few grass in it, and just in 3 years the grass has widly recovered. It turns out that grass depends on animals
  to "massage" the ground with their feet, to fertilize the land and to stimulate re-growth by being grazed.
- Mutations: Change in the nucleotide counterpart of a single nucleotide in a gene is responsible for the difference between
  long and short hair dog breeds
- Local maximums: Sharks have not mutated for couple of millions of years, unlike others. They were stuck in a local maximum due to a small
  step size
- 1830s: Human body consists of a colony of living cells
- Layers of life within humans: 1966: Lynn Margulus in her paper, by analyzing previous researc and piecing them together, concluded that the mitochondrias used 
  to be individual independent bacteria once (before being 'absorbed' into a mutual life within the cells), even with their own genes.
  Mitochondria are known as the powerhouses of the cell. They are organelles that act like a digestive system which takes in nutrients, 
  breaks them down, and creates energy rich molecules for the cell. The biochemical processes of the cell are known as cellular respiration.
  Basically, mitochondrias feed with the chemicals which the cell provides them, and in return they release new chemicals which are required
  by the cell itself to be fed. It is believed (according to the paper of 2008 by Nakajima, Sano and Matsuoka named "Auto-/heretotrophic
  endosymbiosis evolves in a mature stage of ecosystem development in a microcosm composed of an alga, a bacterium and a ciliate"). They used a Protis, which ate bacteria, which it was not able to digest. When staration occured,
  the Protis fed with the 'leftovers' emitted by the bacteria inside it, thus maintaining survival, making a possible explanation of how
  mitochondrias occured.

- Smallest forms of 'life': It is not even cells or mitochondrias which are the smallest forms of structure in living cells. It turns out 
  these to be viroids, which can create compounds on their own. 
- Cooperation: All of these 4 layers have cooperated with each other, in order to create 
  a complex union for the greater good. Division (specialization) of laber occurs and after a certain point cells can no longer survive on
  their own without being part of the system. A group is formed with common tasks and interest. And what is the best way to protect the group?
  By forming a little wall around it, so it becomes a cell!
- Paper: Phagotrophy by a flagellate selects for a prey: A possible origin of multicellularity: An experiment which leaves a Protist instance
  left in an environment with free Algaes (Protist feeds itself by eating an Algae). Soon randomly some Algaes formed together in pairs,
  making it difficult to be eaten by the Protist. After few generations, Algaes formed via mutations in even larger groups together
  close to each other, making it truly impossible to be eaten at all by Protist, thus surviving, and passing their genes in the next generations.

1. Genetic Algorithms:
- They naively mimick biology
- [Mitosis]: cell division that results in two daughter cells each having the same number and kind of chromosomes as the parent 
  nucleus, typical of ordinary tissue growth.
- It's the grandparents' chromosomes which get recombined
- In females, the chromosomes are pre-determined
- Algorithm: Looks for [optimal value] in a space
- [Fitness]: Unfortunately, it drives to local maximums, as it seems
- [step size] ~= [mutation size]  
- [Diversity]: Sum of all distances of the next possible generations cancidates, from the current generation (alread selected candidates) 
- [Fitness]: Same calculation as above
- Both [diversity] and [fitness] combined together can be used to measure a better next generation
 
2. METHOD 1: The higher the chance of developing a [feature], which results in better [fitness], the better the rate of [survival]
- This algorithm gets stuck in local maximum if too small a step is used

3. METHOD 2: [RANK SPACE METHOD]: 
  [Image 9]
- Each individual with best [fitness] gets the best [probability] to be selected to be in the next generation (however, he might not get
  selected at all.)
- It's NOT the probability of the second individual being selected, provided that the first one is NOT selected.
- This algorithm gets stuck in local maximum if too small a step is used
- [Simulated annealing]: 
  Starting with a big step (in order to detect all possible big local changes) and then gradually reset the step.
  Simulated annealing (SA) is a probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function.
- However, even this algorithm cannot "jump" big lapses of evolution, even if a big [step] size is set
  [Image 11]

4. METHOD 3: 
  [Image 12]
- Adding a measure of [diversity], which makes the data spread out from each other
- In order to survive, an organism needs to be able to FIT, and also to be [DIVERSE]
- Example: Perhaps sharks have not experienced further evolution for 6000M years  is because they have already reached their peak point
- This algorithm is able to pass big gaps of missing evolution [Image 13] since it combines the best from X and the best from Y together
- Still, this algorithm is terribly naive

5. Applications of Genetic algorithms

- #1 [Planning]: In planning, where taking certain steps is required 

- #2 [Horse race predictions]: Commensurate values

6. DEMO - Karl Sims:
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBgG_VSP7f8
- A demo of how basic structures learn to move around in different environments
- Funny: Some of the creatures evolved to move by hitting themselves in the chests, ignoring laws of physics
- Some of the "organisms" evolved to catch the reward, while others just tried to block the opponent from getting the reward.
  They have just attacked directly the opponent, totally ignoring the reward. Others evolved to give up on the attack, once the opponent
  has captured it, instead of trying to attack
- The answer: The [space of solutions] in this demonstration is so _rich_ that almost any individual can find a working one, in order to move.
  Otherwise the Genetic algorithms are quite naive themselves. 
  Karl Sims basically imported the right choices in the version space on purpose. He added a lot of 'clues' to the individuals to reach 
  these solutions faster than normal.
- [WHERE IS THE CREDIT PRINCIPLE]: Is it the algorithm that simply works, or is it the developer who hand-tuned it on purpose to work well?
