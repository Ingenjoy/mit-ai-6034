Description:
In this lecture, we consider cognitive architectures, including General Problem Solver, SOAR,
Emotion Machine, Subsumption, and Genesis.  Each is based on a different hypothesis about human
intelligence, such as the importance of language and stories.

Dictionary:
- vernacular    = dialect, jargon
- shuttle       = move ahead and back
- neocortex     = a part of the cerebral cortex concerned with sight and hearing in mammals, regarded as the most recently evolved part of the cortex.
- summa         = summary
- tour de force = an impressive performance or achievement that has been accomplished or managed with great skill

0. General:
- "Thus Spoke Zarathustra: A Book for All and None" is a philosophical novel by German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, composed in four parts
  between 1883 and 1885 and published between 1883 and 1891. Much of the work deals with ideas such as the "eternal recurrence of the same",
  the parable on the "death of God", and the "prophecy" of the Ãœbermensch. It became famous in 2001 via a play.
- This lecture is about combining things together
- Estonia, 2007: They moved a Russian War memorial to the memorial cemetery. They have focused heavily on computers, because they believed
  computation is the future. After the memorial was moved, someone brought the Estonian national network down. It was believed to be the
  Russians, because there's a large ethnic population in Estonia. No computer can understand this story. Except one.
- The next system articulate the idea that what we do as humans is always [problem solving]
- Academic presentation: I will sometimes say "I", but what I mean is "we", and sometimes I will say "we", but what I mean is "they".
- Humans: Humans have came around 50 000 years ago. What was different about them, they were able to tell and understand stories
- TABLE SAW RULE: You never wear a gloves when operating a table saw, because the gloves might get stuck and pull your fingers
  This is something that no one told you, but you would be able to figure out by using your imagination.
  No one tells us many of the things we don't know, but we infer them anyways
- RULE: HOW TO MAKE YOURSELF SMARTER:
  *) LOOK
  *) LISTEN
  *) DRAW
  *) TALK
  Those are the particular mechanisms of language, and therefore THINKING.
- Taking notes in class: Because it engages your motor of linguistics and visual apparatus. And that makes you smarter.
- RULE: BEWARE OF FAST TALKERS
  Because when they talk fast, they jam your language processor, and you can't think.
  And when you don't think, you will buy that car or drink.
  Those people have learned to talk fast to jam your linguistics processor

Different architectures:

1. General Problem Solver (G.P.S.):
- Authors: Newell & Simon (1959)
- You measure the difference between: [d] = (S)-(C)

        ( C )          -------------------------------------> ( S )
                                    [d] - difference
[ Start state of Life] -------------------------------------> [Where you want to be]

- Means-Ends Analysis: [5:31]
- Problems: Combinatorial explosion
- The GPS paradigm eventually evolved into the Soar architecture for artificial intelligence.
- Humans: They needed to define beforehand the [difference] and [operators] in a table. Building that table turned out to be a hard job.
- The GPS paradigm eventually evolved into the Soar architecture for artificial intelligence
- Architecture name: [Problem Solving Hypothesis]

2. SOAR:
- It used to mean: State Operator And Result - but later they've discarded it
- It's conceived by Cognitive scientists
- Long term memory:
    Assertions
    Rules aka Productions
- Short term memory: Most of the activity is happening here
- Influenced by cognitive psychology experiments and how much you can hold in your short term memory
- It's a gigantic rule-based system which shuttles rules between [Long-term memory] and [Short-term memory]
- Preferences: What do you do with more than one [rule] that would work?
  Tie-breaking: SOAR has an elaborate system for breaking ties of rules
- Problem spaces: If you will solve a problem, you need to develop the problem space, and then search through that space
  SOAR is focused on this
- Universal sub-goaling: Whenever you can't think about what to do next, that becomes your next [problem] with its own [problem space],
  [differences], [operators], [rules] and [assertions]
- You start on a high level and them move towards the details
- Architecture name: [Symbol System Hypothesis]
- It's [symbol-centered]
- How to "perceive a perception": Get it into a [symbolic] form

3. The Emotion Machine:
- Author: Marvin Minsky

Thinking on many layers:
- Instinctive reaction:     "Hear a sound => Turn head"
- Learned reaction:         "Seeing a car coming towards us is NOT something which the evolution has trained us to do"
- Deliberate thinking:      "She decides to cross the road"
- Reflective thinking:      "She thinks about her past actions and compares it to others."
- Self-reflective thinking: "Thinking about past events related to the planes one has made for the future"
- Self-conscious thinking:  "How her own actions would be perceived and judged by others"

- Common Sense Hypothesis: In order to think on many layers (above), you have to have "common sense" like people
- Common Sense: How much of it there is there? And how we can go and get it?
- There were attempts to gather "common sense" from the Internet, in order to achieve such kind of "layered thinking"

4. Subsumption architecture:
- Author: Rob Brooks (1980-1990s)
- Brooks became very dissatisfied with the minor progress of robots
- He thought people were thinking in the wrong way
- At the time people thought to build a robot by:

    [vision system] --> [reasoning system] --> [action system]

- Layers of abstraction (Barriers):

|----------------------------------------------------------------|   |
|        Seek                [Vision][Reasoning][Action] systems |  \|/
|----------------------------------------------------------------|
|        Explore             [Vision][Reasoning][Action] systems |   |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|  \|/
|        Wander              [Vision][Reasoning][Action] systems |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|   |
|        Avoiding objects    [Vision][Reasoning][Action] systems |  \|/
|----------------------------------------------------------------|

- Each of these layers might sometimes talk to the lower layer, but its [VRA] system does not break
- Structure of human brain: The human brain is also structured on layers of abstraction:
    *) Reptilian brain  - Instinctual, dinosaur brain
    *) Limbic brain     - Feelings and emotions
    *) Neocortex        - Rational thinking

- [Creature Hypothesis]: Once you get a machine to act as smart as an insect, the rest will be easy
- Brooks thinks that the world world is represented by the following:
    *) No representation:
        Representations make possible to do models and to modify them.

    *) Use the world as a model:
        Instead, Brooks uses the world as a model.
        Each action has a reaction. So you can just get by, by observing the reactions.

       Example:
        You don't have a map of the room, but you can get out from it by observing the path

    *) Finite State Machine:
- This was used by the Roomba robot
- Demo of coke collecting robot (1989): The robot does not have a model of the world, instead it reacts based on interactions with the world
- Imagination: When someone tells you to "imagine something",
  we imagine it between more fluid and perceivable boundaries, more natural and impressive looks, not in outlandish ones

5. Genesis architecture:
- Centered on language
- Language part:
  *) To guide, marshal and interact with the [perception systems]
  *) Enable the description of [events]
- Instinct questions: "Is there anyone with blue jeans in the front row?"
- TABLE SAW RULE: You never wear a gloves when operating a table saw, because the gloves might get stuck and pull your fingers
  This is something that no one told you, but you would be able to figure out by using your imagination.
  No one tells us many of the things we don't know, but we infer them anyways

  EXAMPLE:
  You run down the street with a bucket of water => You splash the water while running.
  This is information which is not publicly available in any database. But you know it.
- We as human beings, have the capacity to imagine perceptual things and their result with our imagination

6. Rat-Baby-Human Room: Experiments in developmental psychology
- A lot of people believe if they participate with their baby in a Harvard experiment, their kid will go to Harvard some day
- Experiment: A rat, a baby and an adult are put in a rectangular room as a subject. Each corner of the room has a hidden pocket with a food.
  The subject is then spinned, so it forgets which corner the pocket was. All subjects - rat, baby, human go to the diagonal corners of the rectangle.
  If we paint one of the walls to blue, the rat and the baby go again to the diagonals. Only the adult goes to the now colored wall.
- Then, how we determine when one is a baby and adult?
- A baby becomes a child when it starts to use the words "left" and "right" to describe the world
- They understand the words "left" and "right" but it doesn't matter until they start to use them to describe the world around them

- Simultenous translation phenomenom: It's very difficult for human to hear something and repeat it. His thinking is being reduced to that of a rat, because his language processor is broken
- Blocking of a language processor: When the language processor is jammed, a rat can't connect a "blue wall" with a "rectangular shape"
- Language is the mediator in making combinations in order to build descriptions
- RULE: HOW TO MAKE YOURSELF SMARTER:
  *) LOOK
  *) LISTEN
  *) DRAW
  *) TALK
  Those are the particular mechanisms of language, and therefore THINKING.
- Taking notes in class: Because it engages your motor of linguistics and visual apparatus. And that makes you smarter.
- RULE: BEWARE OF FAST TALKERS
  Because when they talk fast, they jam your language processor, and you can't think.
  And when you don't think, you will buy that car or drink.
  Those people have learned to talk fast to jam your linguistics processor
