Mega-R3. Games, Minimax, Alpha-Beta

1. General:
- In Min-Max it doesn't matter much what kind of search you use in order to get the answer
- Answer: A-C-H 

2. Nuclear options principle:
*) Alpha:   MAX: >===> (Negative infinity: Maximizer loses)
*) Beta:    MIN: >===> (Positive infinity: Minimizer loses
- Default values: -/+ infinity
- MAX: Alpha -Infinity
- MIN: Beta  +Infinity
- They start to increase/decrease their numbers until they cannot do it no longer

3. Snowhite principle:
- You start with the Alpha/Beta which you have inherited from your parents
- But if you find down the way a trait that you is better, you take it and keep it
- In tree search: You start with the default value of the MAX(imizer) or MIN(imizer) which is:
MAX: Alpha -Infinity
MIN: Beta  +Infinity
  and compare it with the current value. If it is better than -/+ Infinity for the MAX/MIN, you keep it.
- The leaves which contain lower values in their children, can be cut off

4. Alpha-beta pruning:
Good explanation of the pruning:
