Description:
In this lecture, we consider the nature of human intelligence, including our ability to tell and understand stories.
We discuss the most useful elements of our inner language: classification, transitions, trajectories, and story sequences.

Dictionary:
- bipedal       = sitting on two legs
- conspicuous   = obvious
- conical       = shaped like a cone /\
- pelvis        = the bones that form a bowl-shaped structure in the area below the waist at the top of the legs, and to which the leg bones and spine are joined
- mastadon      = a large, hairy elephant which is now extinct
- enablement    = the process of making someone able to do something, or making something possible
- reification   = the act of changing something abstract (= existing as a thought or idea) into something real
- barreling ahead = straight and quickly continue forward
- ashtray       = utensil for storing the ashes (of a cigar)
- conveyance    = transportation
- denote        = mark something
- aphorism      = concise, terse, laconic, and/or memorable expression of a general truth or principle
- grizzling     = disapproving
- pronoun       = a word that replaces a noun in a sentence. Example: I, me, mine, myself, she, her, hers, herself, we, us, ours and ourselves
- antecedent    = a word or phrase that a pronoun refers back to
- superfluous   = not needed
- gratuitous    = without a particular needed reason
- admonition    = a harsh warning

0. General:
- This lecture presents different ways to represent data and concepts
- Basically, often knowledge or concepts are expressed in a representation, which can be fit to one of the 3 models which are present in this lecture
- The AI systems often have no idea about what they are doing
- Trivia: Patrick Winston makes sure to remember the names of all his students in the beginning of the semester
- Bosendorfer piano has extra octave keys on the bottom
- Some professional piano players when playing on a new Bosendorfer need someone to cover the extra keys for them, because they are traned to rely on their peripherial vision
- You learn a concept by giving a name to it
- Trivia: Patrick Winston does not address himself with shortened "Pat", because he thinks it's a unit measure for butter
- PRINCIPE: "If you think about something only in one way, you have no recourse when you get stuck." - Marvin Minsky

1. History of humans:
- Humans have been around for ~200 000 years
- Evolutionary characteristic: increasing brain size
- Humans became bipedal way before they had a larger brain...
- Neanderthal: They've had big heads and pelvises, however they were working only with stone tools
- There are a lot of scenarios about why Homo Sapiens, despite being nothing special in the beginning, turned out to be dominant
- These dominant Homo Sapiens were located at the Central East Africa region and dominated the rest
- 25 000 years ago, Homo Sapiens were doing cave drawings, making primitive jewelry, dedicated to women
- Humans lowed to put on them objects which show status from early times...
- Those were [symbols]. Symbols ld to language
- Noam Chomsky: "It's the ability to put together 2 concepts, in order form a 3rd new concept, without disturbing the first 2 and without limits"

2. Stories:
- Stories: Humans are separated from other primates by the ability to understand stories
- Education: It's all about storytelling and understanding
- The language with which we [talk] and we [think] are different!
- Paradox: Sometimes when people remember a particular scene, they do not remember in which language the conversation was held

3. Semantic nets:
- [reification]: the links between different [concepts] can also imply other things. Example: [murder] implies that the target is [dead]
                 this allows the links to be treated as objects/concepts as well
- [localization layers]: Marvin Minsky modeled these relationships via [frames]: [agent] --> [victim]
- [problem of parasitic semantics]: a lot of the meanings can be inferred. Example: if someone kills someone else, then they might as well have a motive.
                                    At least this is what we think and what we might infer to the machine as well.
                                    The difference is, even if we project this to the machine, it doesn't mean that the machine know it. Only we know it.
4. Representation - Classes. Classification:
- We know about things, but we know them on different levels
- Example:
  [tool] - it's a very abstract concept, you cannot link a picture to it
  [mac]  - The computer Mac, or the food Mac?
- [general] -> [base] -> [specific]
- The human mind has a [base] type of data as a greatest percentage of its storage [Image 06]

5. Representation - Transition: [Image 07]
- Humans mostly think about change causing change (verbs)
- In engineering, rather, you learn about the [state] of something
- All of this seems to be heavily connected with vision
- [vocabulary of change]: Illustrating how objects (if at all) change [21:30]
- [vocabulary of change elements]:
    [⬇︎] - Decrease
    [⬆︎] - Increase
    [Δ] - Change
    [A] - Appear
    [D] - Disappear
   ![⬇︎] - Does not decrease
   ![⬆︎] - Does not increase
   ![Δ] - Does not change
   ![A] - Does not appear
   ![D] - Does not disappear
- [analogies]: by making  stories with similar actions but different actors, the listeners might presume that the actors might do the same actions
- Example: the way a car crashes to the wall and a photon "crashes" to the wall of a camera (it makes it easier to understand the 2nd concept, once a familiar concept has been provided)

6. Representation - Trajectory:
- Linguistics: A lot of what we say, is actually [objects] moving through [trajectories]
- Example: He is fine.
           The weather becomes cold.
- [TRAJECTORY FRAME]:

[Co-agent] [Agent]
  O          O     __________
\||\       /||\_/ [Instrument]
 /\         /\     -----\\---
/  \       /  \         \\\_______
                         | Object | --------------->
                         |________|
             [Source] ----------------------------------- [Destination]
                                   (o) (o) (o) (o)
            ._.                     [Conveyance]
             O /
           /||/
            /\
           /  \
       [Beneficiary]

- Example:
    "Bake a cake with a friend."
    "Prices rose, economy stalled"
- This model helps us understand the [role] of each [object] in the concept [Image 08]
- The Wall Street corpus has good data for trajectories. In 100 sentences there are about 25 transitions or trajectories.
- There are "keywords" which denote if the sentence is a [transition] or a [trajectory]: by, via, with, for, to...

7. Story sequence:
- A story sequence can be a single sentence
- Example: "Pat conformed Chris."
  // We get an idea of what might've happened, but we don't know exactly
- However, there might me multiple interpretations - therefore - trajectory|transition models for the [story]
- PRINCIPE: "If you think about something only in one way, you have no recourse when you get stuck." - Marvin Minsky
- Multiple representations means that you have multiple ways to gather [regularity] from the world and model it
- This model helps easily identify who did the [action] (the [agent]), to whom (the [target]), and what was the outcome ([result]), thus model situations/stories
- "conformed" and "terrorized" are [abstract] actions. "kissed" is [concrete] ("base") action
- Using this for instance you can create a classifier which detects if a speaker is very intelligent or manipulative (using a lot of abstract actions) or someone simple and sincere
- [abstract] actions are hard to understand and imagine
- [simple/base] actions are easier to understand. They stimulate a mental "hallucination" in the mind of the listener
- [hallucination]: [base] action which can be imaged
- "kiss" helps to [hallucinate]: one's lips has touched the lips of the other
- however, again, there are different possible scenarios, based on the relationships between the actors: (chris and pat are lovers, chris and pat are relatives, chris is a frog and pat is a prince...)
- We have "libraries" in our head which create live images for certain actions like "kiss"
- [networks] vs [sequences]: it's easier to imagine events as line of events => [story sequence]
- [sequence] imposes better constraints to model events
- If you a music instrument, you will realize how important sequences are: It's very difficult to start playing a song from the middle
- Instead, you need to go to the beginning of a [measure]: the beginning of the verse, of the melody, etc.
- Human memory is very rooted to sequences of items
- [!] This explains why storytelling is important. People like events with easy and natural sequences

8. Libraries of stories:
- There are standard stories
- We can know something by knowing what its superclass is
- General concepts have smaller concepts underneath them:
- Example: Events -> Disasters -> Earthquakes ...
- If we read a newspaper article about a wedding, we know it is an [event] (superclass) and we expect to read the same things for an event,
  with the exception, that we will expect "wedding-specific" "mental slots" to be filled in with the data of the actual article (e.g. the names of the bride and broom, the location, ...)
- Each of the [subclasses] of the event [superclass] have their specific [properties], which we expect to fill with the actual data for the current case
- Basically, we move from the main [frame] to the [subframes] (role, transition, trajectory)
- This is how we model the world
- Sometimes it can be a challenge, reading a newspaper, to fill in the properties of the subclasses...
- Determined experimentally: Children stories are way harder sometimes than the adult stories in meaning. A children story can be about anything. [Image 12]
- You need to make sure that when you create a story, it somehow matches an existing storytelling model. Do not create syntactic difficulty. So it is easy to relate to something previous

9. How to write amazing stories!:

- [⭑] RULE 1: DON'T USE [PRONOUNS]
  - Examples: [ I, me, mine, myself, she, her, hers, herself, we, us, ours and ourselves ]
  - they place additional syntactic burden on understanding the story by the reader. It forces them to think about the antecedents
  - Germans and Russians languages have gender versions of nouns, which makes it 3 times harder to understand the antecedents

- [⭑] RULE 2: DON'T [FORMER] OR [LATTER]
  - No one is able to decode those words without stopping and going back to the previous thing mentioned

- [⭑] RULE 3: DON'T CALL A [SHOVEL] A [SPADE]
  - High school teachers misteach to not repeat words. As a result, people go to great lengths to find synonyms
  - The user is confused if its a (subtle) _transition_ or a forced attempt to not use the same word...
