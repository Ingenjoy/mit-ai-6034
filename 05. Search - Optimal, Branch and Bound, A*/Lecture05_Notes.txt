Lecture 05: Search: Optimal, Branch and Bound, A*
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQ-vAmdAOI

1. General:
- In Public administration, the explanation of why something is done is different than the reason/purpose.
- "Dead Horse Principle": A path which has already been extended and not leading anywhere is filtered out.

2. Heuristic distance:
The distance from the currend node to the goal node (by dotted line, not actual lines)

2.1: Oracle method:
- Guess the shortest lenght path :)

2.2. Basic Branch and Bound
- Find the shortest path by seeing each length to node if its optimal or not
- Then expand (look) through all possible paths to see if there is one with lower length 
- It tries the optimal path on each iteration
- Almost brute-forcing like the British Museum Method
- All possible node paths are extended (repeated)
- Demo: Extensions: 835

2.3. Branch and bound with Extended list filtering:
- Start searching again
- Don't extend the already searched letters
- Demo: Extensions: 38
- Demo: Does look left

2.4. Admissable Heuristic:
- calculate "potential lengths" with estimations
- Demo: Extensions: 70
- Demo: Does not look left

2.5. A* (A star)
- A* = Branch & Bound with Extended List Filtering + Branch & Bound with admissable heurestics
- works well on maps, but not guaranteed to work correctly on merged points

3. heurestics:
- admissable
- consistency - estimations to same lenght aligned nodes, should be same
