- AI is all about feature detection
- Most of the feature detectio algorithms are hand-written with a lot of manual effort
- Coming up and tuning the features is one of the most time-consuming things in ML
- The same part of the brain can process different kind of senses
- The complexity of the algorithm comes from the data not from the algorithm 
- The first thing the brain does when it receives an image is to look for edges/lines
- One neuron is looking for vertial and other for horizontal edges
- Edge detection via neurons is more useful than knowing simply where the pixels are
- Sparce coding: taking small areas of image (Convolution), modeling their values in a vector,
  then comparing the vector with the dictionary, then assiging a match coefficient to each vector
- Geoffrey Hinton's method was to combine in the "hidden" layers groups of "edges" (higher level layers)
- Most websites have good data but simple algorithms => Good fit and user XP

1. Neural Nets:
- Hillclimbing algorithm is used in Neural Nets traversing
- XOR is difficult to be modelled with only 1 layer of neurons. At least 2 are required.
