Description:
This lecture begins with a high-level view of learning, then covers nearest 
neighbors using several graphical examples. We then discuss how to learn motor 
skills such as bouncing a tennis ball, and consider the effects of sleep deprivation.

0. General:
- Puzzle: What would a dog think Diet Coke is for?
- The lay of the learning land
- Always try the simplest thing before something complex which you are less likely to understand
- THE PRECEDENT PRINCIPLE (Weak Similarity Principle): If something is similar in some respects then it might be similar in other respects
  It is being used in legal, medical, law cases and other.
- You can teach people very well by telling them example stories for everything
- Application: High dimensional spaces are good for correlation tracking
- Recycling age: This is the age of recycling ideas, since for most of them now computers are fast enough
- NO CAKE WITHOUT FLUOR PRINCIPLE: You cannot have a good answer without having good relevant data
- Sleep: Guard your sleep like you guard your wallet

1. Learning:
- Learning: It is important to learn in an intelligent way, avoiding "Bulldozer intelligence" thinking
- We are learning by trying to recognize a category, but also by trying to apply some PRECEDENT
- You don't learn as much without _problem solving_

2. LEARNING TYPES:

    2.1. REGULARITY: Learning based on observations of regularity
         - Computers are pretty good at it
         - A branch of "Bulldozer Computing"

         *) NEAREST NEIGHBOURS (Pattern recognition)
         *) NEURAL NETS (Mimic biology)
         *) BOOSTING (Theory)

    2.2. CONSTRAINTS: The human-like approach
         *) ONE SHOT LEARNING: You learn something _definite_ from each experience/experiment
         *) EXPLANATION BASED LEARNING: 
            - "I get As at subjects where I can convince myself what is taught is true."
            - Learning is a byproduct of self-explanation.

3. Nearest neighbors sorting mechanism:
   === Article sorting ===
   - Algorithm: Build first the Decision Boundaries, using the perpendicular bisectors method
   - Algorithm: The probe question is relatively small (word)

   - A better method: By measuring the angle towards the nearest cluster destinations [Picture 04]
   - This is a very simple implementation, can be done more complicated

   === Robot arm ===
   - Algorithm: 1. Childhood - Record all the (possible) actions of the robot arm in a table. Make sure include all forces (torque, rotation, etc.)
                2. Pick object - Set the desired location to pick an object, and then search within the childhood for the closest match
   - This method was initially rejected, because computers were not powerful enough for it
   - At first it's bad (it's still writing in the table),  but then it gets better (the machine has more options to interpolate)

4. Neuroscience:
- Brain: The human brain has 10^10 neurons
- Brain: The cerebellum has 10^11 neurons
- The human brain might be a gigantic table with rules which we fill as we live on

5. Problems:

   === 1. Uniform data distribution problem === 
   The sample of data should be equally random spread, not with concentrations about certain axis (Y, Z).
   So, we have to calculate the variance

   === 2. What matters problem ===
   - If the answer does not depend on one of the axes at all (or on the data at all).
   - BUILD CAKE WITHOUT FLUOR PRINCIPLE: You cannot achieve a good result without relevant data for it
   - Building an AI to predict when someone is going to go bankrupt => NO, because the available data is not relevant for this

6. Sleep:
- United States Army: How much sleep you need
- The First Gulf War: The most stuied war
- Due to lack of sleep, the US tanks made fratricidal attacks on their own allies
  Their ordnance was not impaired. Their perception of where the target is, who is the target and if there is target at all was.
- After 36 hours the firing teams said: "We are doing great". And they were firing at hospitals, churches, mosques, schools. And themselves.
- LOSS OF SLEEP _DESTROYS_ ABILITIES
- Winston Churchil divided his sleep to two phases, so he can work 1.5x.
  Dividing sleep helps get a better throughput: "You get more affect of your sleep if you divide it to two"
- Daily naps help keep a stable throughtput
- Coffee: Caffeine does help but only after 48 hours
- Sleep deprivation: 24h without sleep is equal to being drunk
- Why cats and dogs think the diet coke makes people fat? Because it's only fat people who drink it
  Dogs and cats don't have the ability to _string together events into narratives_.
  They see the corellation, but do not understand the cause.
- Story narratives: Humans can link events into story narratives
