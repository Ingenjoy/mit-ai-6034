Description:
Why do "cats" and "dogs" end with different plural sounds, and how do we learn this?
We can represent this problem in terms of distinctive features, and then generalize. We end this lecture with a brief discussion of how to approach AI problems.

0. General:
- nugatory: small
- pistareen: small spanish coin. something not important
- supererogatory - excessive
- hind legs: back legs
- emeritus: Retired, but allowed to hold their title
- Telugu: Indian language. Telugu is a Dravidian language native to India.
It stands alongside Hindi, English, and Bengali as one of the few languages with official status in more than one Indian state
- Phonology: The branch of linguistics that deals with systems of sounds
- French: Spoken by 52M
- Telugu: Spoken  by 56M
- What if God were an Engineer? Or what if I were God and I were an engineer?
- Acoustics: Acoustics is the interdisciplinary science that deals with the study of all mechanical waves in gases, liquids, 
  and solids including topics such as vibration, sound, ultrasound and infrasound.
- catecism - summary of something

- [PRINCIPLE]: YOU CAN'T LEARN UNLESS YOU ALMOST KNOW ALREADY

1. Learning mechanisms:
  [BASIC METHODS]            ------> [NAIVE BIOLOGICAL MIMICRY]
- Nearest neighbours                 - Neural networks
- Identification trees               - Genetic algorithms
- Been around for a long time
  best option when you dont know
  what to do with the problem

- These algorithms are quite simple. Getting them to work is like getting a dog to walk on his hind legs only
- You can make it happen, but they never happen to do it quite well
- And you have to do a lot of trickery and training, to make it happen

2. Focus on the problem, rather than the mechanism:
- Deep theory, FIOS

3. Phonology:
- Phonological rules
- Plurals: vibrating "zzz" sound. The throat vibrates
- Dogs: ZZZZZZ
- Cats: ssssss

- Experiment: Yip and Sussman
- Morris Halle: Latvian-American linguist and an Institute Professor and professor emeritus of linguistics at MIT

4. Distinctive Feature Theory:
- [phones]: phone is any distinct speech sound or gesture, regardless of whether the exact sound is critical to the meanings of words. 
  In contrast, a phoneme is a speech sound that, in a given language, if it were swapped with another phoneme, would change the meaning of the word. Phones are absolute, not specific to any language, 
- [phonemes]: but phonemes can be discussed only in reference to specific languages.
- [speech] = set of distinctive features
- Thea features are binary. Example: Does it produce [zzz] or [sss] sound?. + voiced, - voiced 
- Distinctive feature: The most basic unit of phonological structure that may be analyzed in phonological theory.
- 14 basic dinstinctive features 
- 2^14 = 16 000 phonemes
- No language on earth uses more than 100 phonemes
- English: 40 phonemes
- [Hallucination]: Some of the distinctive features are hallucinated, without them being even there
- [The McGurk effect]

  Perceptual phenomenon that demonstrates an interaction between hearing and vision in speech perception. 
  The illusion occurs when the auditory component of one sound is paired with the visual component of another sound, leading to the perception of a third sound.[1] The visual information a person gets from seeing a person speak changes the way they hear the sound
- The visual perception can influence the auditory perception, due to conflicting signals.
  What you see has a large influence on what you hear.
- It's very difficult to pronounce things correctly, if you don't see the speaker
- Foreigns are not able to speak as a native, because they are not watching the mouth of the speaker
- Different people have trouble pronouncing different languages, because their own language does not have those phones
- The vocal cords are just like a marionette: They produce the sounds which are required by moving

5. Words:
- [syllabic]: can that sound form the core of a syllable?

6. Sussman-Yip Machine/Leaner:
  [Image 04]
- [propagators]: information can be emitted to both directions 
- [method]: they decided to analyze only the first part of the word, ignoring the last dound [Image 05]
- [Algorithm]:
  The final algorithm they reached:
  1. Collect [positive] and [negative] examples 
  2. [Seed]. Picked a [positive] example to start from. Called it [seed]
  3. [Generalization] They turn - and + to * and see if the generalization works.
     Generalizing with the [positive] example until it matches/correlates with a [negative] example
- The above algorithm learns phonological rules [Image 08-09]
- If the last sound is with voiced pronunciation => plural [Z] [Image 10]
- It uses [Beam] search

7. Sparse space:
- When you have a high dimensional [sparce space] with enough distance between the examples, it is easier to draw a hyperplane
  separating the examples

  [Central Limit Theorem]:
  The central limit theorem (CLT) is a statistical theory that states that given a sufficiently large sample size from a population
  with a finite level of variance, the mean of all samples from the same population will be approximately equal to the mean of the 
  population. Furthermore, all of the samples will follow an approximate normal distribution pattern, with all variances being approximately equal to the variance of the population divided by each sample's size.  

- If there's enough space between the phonemes/examples they will be easy to separate, as they are spread randomly, but at even distances
- [consonants] are easier to spot than [vowels] because they have multiple pairs with one distinctive feature

8. David Marr:
- Sussman-Yips's experiment was in line with Marr's catechism

[Marr's catechism]:
- When dealing with an AI problem:
1. Specify the problem
2. Make a representation suitable of the problem (In the current example: The vowel/consonants features)
- A good representation makes the right things explicit
- Exposes a constraint. A constraint is the key to formulating the processing, leading to a solution => good model
- Localness criteria 
3. Determine an approach/method (constraints start to emerge)
4. Pick a mechanism/devise an algorithm (write an algorithm to do an experiment)
5. Experiment

- A lot of researches in AI become fans of a particular approach mechanism and they try to generalize it, without differentiating
- "Neural nets are so cool, I think the entire human intelligence can be explained with a suitable neural net"
- They try to apply it where it is not the right thing
- They could say "Let's make a neural net, which properly pluralizes neural nets", trying to force-fit the mechanism
